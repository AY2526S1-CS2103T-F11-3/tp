**TeachMate is a desktop application designed specifically for NUS Teaching Assistants (TAs)** to streamline student management across multiple tutorial groups and modules. Built for TAs who prefer typing over clicking, TeachMate combines the speed of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the clarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* If you are interested in using TeachMate, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in developing TeachMate, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
