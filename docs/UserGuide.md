# TeachMate User Guide

TeachMate is a **desktop application designed specifically for NUS Teaching Assistants (TAs)** to streamline student management across multiple tutorial groups and modules. Built for TAs who prefer typing over clicking, TeachMate combines the speed of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the clarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## Why TeachMate?

As an NUS TA juggling multiple modules, you face unique challenges:
- **Tracking attendance** across 13 weeks for dozens of students
- **Managing grades** for various assignments and assessments
- **Scheduling consultations** while keeping track of who needs extra help
- **Remembering student details** - who's struggling with OOP concepts, who excels at algorithms
- **Switching between modules** like CS2103T and CS2101 throughout the week

TeachMate solves these problems by putting everything in one place:

### What TeachMate Does for You

**Instant Student Access** - View a student's complete profile including modules, grades, consultation history, attendance pattern, and your personal notes. No more hunting through spreadsheets or scrolling through email threads.

**Effortless Attendance Tracking** - Mark attendance with a single command. See visual color-coded grids showing each student's 13-week attendance pattern at a glance - green for present, red for absent, grey for no record.

**Smart Grade Management** - Add and update grades by assignment name, delete specific grades, and see all assignment scores displayed on each student card. No more maintaining separate Excel files.

**Consultation Scheduling** - Record consultation appointments with date and time, view upcoming consultations for specific students, and keep track of who needs follow-up help.

**Personalized Student Notes** - Add remarks to remember each student's learning journey, challenges, and progress. Track observations like which concepts they struggle with or how they're improving over time.

**Multi-Module Organization** - Filter students by module to focus on one tutorial group at a time. Tag students with labels like "struggling" or "excellent" and filter by tags to identify who needs attention.

**Fast Keyboard Workflow** - Every action is a quick typed command. During live tutorials, you can mark attendance, add grades, or schedule consultations in seconds without taking your hands off the keyboard.

TeachMate is optimized for NUS workflows, using familiar formats like NUS student IDs and module codes. If you're comfortable with the terminal and type quickly, TeachMate will help you manage your students significantly faster than traditional point-and-click applications or multiple spreadsheets.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TeachMate.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/tp_home.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all students.

   * `add n/John Doe s/A0123456X e/johnd@u.nus.edu m/CS2103T` : Adds a student named `John Doe` with student ID `A0123456X` to TeachMate.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/struggling` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/struggling`, `t/struggling t/needsHelp` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME s/STUDENT_ID`, `s/STUDENT_ID n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list (must be a positive integer)
* `WEEK` must be a number between 1 and 13 (inclusive), representing the teaching week
* `present|absent|unmark` specifies the attendance status (case-insensitive):
  - `present`: Mark as present
  - `absent`: Mark as absent
  - `unmark`: Remove attendance record (return to unmarked state)
* The status must come **after** the week parameter
* Use `all` (without `s/` prefix) to mark all students at once for bulk operations
* The student must exist in TeachMate
* Marking attendance for the same week again will update the previous record
* Using `unmark` on an already unmarked week has no effect

**Success message:**
* Individual: `Marked attendance for [name]: Week [week] - [status]` or `Unmarked attendance for [name]: Week [week]`
* All students: `Marked attendance for all students: Week [week] - [status] ([count] students)` or `Unmarked attendance for all students: Week [week] ([count] students)`

**Error messages:**
* If the index is invalid: `The student index provided is invalid`
* If the student ID is not found: `No student found with ID: [ID]`
* If the week is invalid: `Week should be a number between 1 and 13 (inclusive)`
* If the status is invalid: `Invalid attendance status. Use 'present', 'absent', or 'unmark'.`

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**
* Attendance can be viewed in detail using the `view` command, which shows week-by-week records
* When marking all students, the command affects every student in TeachMate regardless of the current filtered list
* Present attendance is marked with ✓ and absent with ✗ in the attendance record
* Unmarked attendance appears as grey boxes in the UI (no record)
* Using index is faster when working with the displayed list
* Use `unmark` to correct mistakes or reset attendance for a specific week
</box>

Examples:
* `attendance 1 w/1 present` - Marks the first student in the list as present for week 1
* `attendance 2 w/2 absent` - Marks the second student in the list as absent for week 2
* `attendance 1 w/1 unmark` - Unmarks attendance for the first student for week 1
* `attendance s/A0123456X w/1 present` - Marks student A0123456X as present for week 1
* `attendance s/A0123456X w/2 absent` - Marks student A0123456X as absent for week 2
* `attendance s/A0123456X w/2 unmark` - Unmarks attendance for student A0123456X for week 2
* `attendance all w/1 present` - Marks all students as present for week 1
* `attendance all w/2 absent` - Marks all students as absent for week 2
* `attendance all w/3 unmark` - Unmarks attendance for all students for week 3

* When editing tags, the existing tags will be removed and replaced (not cumulative)
* You can remove all module codes by typing `m/` without specifying any module codes
* Editing consultations should still follow the same format as in the `add` command
* **Editing grades:** Use `g/ASSIGNMENT_NAME:SCORE` to update an existing grade. The assignment must already exist for the student, otherwise an error will be shown.
* **Editing attendance:** Use `w/WEEK_NUMBER:STATUS` to update attendance for a specific week (1-13). Status can be `present`, `absent`, or `unmark` (to remove the attendance record).
* **Editing remarks:** Use `r/REMARK` to update the remark for a student.

<box type="warning" seamless>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TeachMate home folder.

**Q**: What is the student ID format?<br>
**A**: Student IDs must follow the NUS format: A followed by exactly 7 digits and 1 uppercase letter (e.g., A0123456X, A1234567B).

**Q**: Can I add a student without module codes?<br>
**A**: No, every student must have at least one module code when using the `add` command.

**Q**: Why does the edit command still accept phone (p/) and address (a/) prefixes?<br>
**A**: For backward compatibility with older data that may contain phone and address information. New students added via the `add` command will only have student-specific fields (student ID, module codes).

**Q**: Can tags contain spaces?<br>
**A**: No, tags must be alphanumeric without spaces. Use camelCase or single words (e.g., `needsHelp`, `struggling`).

**Q**: Can I edit or delete grades after adding them?<br>
**A**: Yes! You can update grades by using the `grade` command with the same assignment name (case-insensitive). For example, if a student has "Midterm: 85", running `grade 1 g/Midterm:90` will update it to 90. To delete grades, use the `deletegrade` command. For example, `deletegrade 1 g/Midterm` will remove the Midterm grade from student 1.

**Q**: Why can't I add grades to a person without a student ID?<br>
**A**: Grades are only applicable to students. The system requires students to have a student ID to ensure grades are tracked for the right individuals.

**Q**: What happens to grades when I edit or delete a student?<br>
**A**: When you edit a student's information (name, email, etc.), their grades are preserved. If you delete a student, all their associated grades are permanently deleted as well.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
