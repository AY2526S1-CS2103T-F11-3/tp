# TeachMate User Guide

TeachMate is a **desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs) to manage university students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TeachMate can help you manage your students faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TeachMate.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all students.

   * `add n/John Doe s/A0123456X e/johnd@u.nus.edu m/CS2103T` : Adds a student named `John Doe` with student ID `A0123456X` to TeachMate.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/struggling` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/struggling`, `t/struggling t/needsHelp` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME s/STUDENT_ID`, `s/STUDENT_ID n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warning:** This action cannot be undone. All student data will be permanently deleted.
</box>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

TeachMate data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TeachMate data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TeachMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause TeachMate to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TeachMate home folder.

**Q**: What is the student ID format?<br>
**A**: Student IDs must follow the NUS format: A followed by exactly 7 digits and 1 uppercase letter (e.g., A0123456X, A1234567B).

**Q**: Can I add a student without module codes?<br>
**A**: No, every student must have at least one module code when using the `add` command.

**Q**: Why does the edit command still accept phone (p/) and address (a/) prefixes?<br>
**A**: For backward compatibility with older data that may contain phone and address information. New students added via the `add` command will only have student-specific fields (student ID, module codes).

**Q**: Can tags contain spaces?<br>
**A**: No, tags must be alphanumeric without spaces. Use camelCase or single words (e.g., `needsHelp`, `struggling`).

**Q**: Can I edit or delete grades after adding them?<br>
**A**: Currently, grades cannot be edited or deleted through commands. If you need to modify a grade, you can manually edit the `data/addressbook.json` file (make sure to back it up first), or delete the student and re-add them with the correct grades.

**Q**: Why can't I add grades to a person without a student ID?<br>
**A**: Grades are only applicable to students. The system requires students to have a student ID to ensure grades are tracked for the right individuals.

**Q**: What happens to grades when I edit or delete a student?<br>
**A**: When you edit a student's information (name, email, etc.), their grades are preserved. If you delete a student, all their associated grades are permanently deleted as well.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
