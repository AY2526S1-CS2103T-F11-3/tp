# TeachMate User Guide

**TeachMate** is a **desktop application designed specifically for NUS Teaching Assistants (TAs)** to streamline student management across multiple tutorial groups and modules. Built for TAs who prefer typing over clicking, TeachMate combines the speed of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the clarity of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why TeachMate?

### The TA's Challenge

As an NUS TA juggling multiple modules, you face unique challenges:

| üéØ Challenge | üí° Solution |
|-------------|------------|
| **Tracking attendance** across 13 weeks for dozens of students | Visual color-coded grids at a glance |
| **Managing grades** for various assignments and assessments | Centralized grade tracking on student cards |
| **Scheduling consultations** while keeping track of who needs extra help | Built-in consultation records |
| **Remembering student details** - who's struggling with OOP concepts | Personalized remarks system |
| **Switching between modules** like CS2103T and CS2101 | Multi-module filtering and organization |

### What TeachMate Does for You

**‚ö° Instant Student Access** - View a student's complete profile including modules, grades, consultation history, attendance pattern, and your personal notes. No more hunting through spreadsheets or scrolling through email threads.

**üìä Effortless Attendance Tracking** - Mark attendance with a single command. See visual color-coded grids showing each student's 13-week attendance pattern at a glance - **green** for present, **red** for absent, **grey** for no record.

**üìù Smart Grade Management** - Add and update grades by assignment name, delete specific grades, and see all assignment scores displayed on each student card. No more maintaining separate Excel files.

**üìÖ Consultation Scheduling** - Record consultation appointments with date and time, view upcoming consultations for specific students, and keep track of who needs follow-up help.

**‚úèÔ∏è Personalized Student Notes** - Add remarks to remember each student's learning journey, challenges, and progress. Track observations like which concepts they struggle with or how they're improving over time.

**üè∑Ô∏è Multi-Module Organization** - Filter students by module to focus on one tutorial group at a time. Tag students with labels like "struggling" or "excellent" and filter by tags to identify who needs attention.

**‚å®Ô∏è Fast Keyboard Workflow** - Every action is a quick typed command. During live tutorials, you can mark attendance, add grades, or schedule consultations in seconds without taking your hands off the keyboard.

**Optimized for NUS Workflows** - TeachMate uses familiar formats like NUS student IDs and module codes. If you're comfortable with the terminal and type quickly, TeachMate will help you manage your students significantly faster than traditional point-and-click applications or multiple spreadsheets.

## Command Format Guide

<box type="tip" seamless>

### How Commands Work in TeachMate

TeachMate uses a simple command-based system. Think of it like typing instructions to the app. Here's what you need to know:

</box>

**1. Basic Command Structure**
* Every command starts with a command word (like `add`, `list`, `delete`)
* Commands are followed by parameters that provide the details
* Each parameter has a prefix (like `n/` for name, `s/` for student ID) followed by the value

**Example:** `add n/John Doe s/A0123456X`
* `add` is the command
* `n/John Doe` means name is "John Doe"
* `s/A0123456X` means student ID is "A0123456X"

**2. Understanding the Format Notation**

When you see a command format like this:
```
add n/NAME s/STUDENT_ID e/EMAIL [t/TAG]
```

Here's what the symbols mean:
* **Words in CAPS** (like `NAME`) = Replace with your actual information
* **[Square brackets]** = This part is optional - you can include it or skip it
* **`‚Ä¶` after a bracket** = You can repeat this part multiple times

**3. Common Prefixes You'll Use**
* `n/` = Student name
* `s/` = Student ID (e.g., A0123456X)
* `e/` = Email address
* `m/` = Module code (e.g., CS2103T)
* `t/` = Tag (a label like "struggling" or "excellent")
* `w/` = Week number (for attendance)
* `g/` = Grade (assignment name and score)
* `r/` = Remark (a note about the student)

**4. Helpful Tips**
* You can type parameters in any order - `add n/John s/A0123456X` works the same as `add s/A0123456X n/John`
* Don't worry about capitalization - commands work the same whether you type `ADD` or `add`
* When typing commands, just follow the pattern shown in the examples below

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Tip:** If you're ever unsure about a command, just type `help` to see all available commands with examples!

</box>

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TeachMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause TeachMate to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

**Q: Why does the edit command still accept phone (p/) and address (a/) prefixes?**

For backward compatibility with older data that may contain phone and address information. New students added via the `add` command will only have student-specific fields (student ID, module codes).
</box>

**Q: Can tags contain spaces?**

No, tags must be alphanumeric without spaces. Use camelCase or single words (e.g., `needsHelp`, `struggling`).

**Q: Can I edit or delete grades after adding them?**

Yes! You can update grades by using the `grade` command with the same assignment name (case-insensitive). For example, if a student has "Midterm: 85", running `grade 1 g/Midterm:90` will update it to 90. To delete grades, use the `deletegrade` command. For example, `deletegrade 1 g/Midterm` will remove the Midterm grade from student 1.

**Q: Why can't I add grades to a person without a student ID?**

Grades are only applicable to students. The system requires students to have a student ID to ensure grades are tracked for the right individuals.

**Q: What happens to grades when I edit or delete a student?**

When you edit a student's information (name, email, etc.), their grades are preserved. If you delete a student, all their associated grades are permanently deleted as well.

## Known issues

<box type="warning" seamless>

**1. Multiple Screen Issue**

If you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen.

**Solution:** Delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**2. Minimized Help Window Issue**

If you minimize the Help Window and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear.

**Solution:** Manually restore the minimized Help Window.
